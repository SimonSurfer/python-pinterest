~~The most complete python wrapper for the Pinterest API.~~

Not complete by any means, but this has most (as many as I could find) of the API endpoints fleshed out. As of right now the read-only endpoints are available if you have a valid OAuth access_token already. That is, you won't be able to pin, repin, comment, etc until I figure that out. Additionally, there is no easy way to get an OAuth access token right now, but I'm also working on that.

So, in short, if you have an access token already AND you only care about consuming API data this client might be for you.

Stay tuned.
